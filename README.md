# AppReactMHT-P8009

Install dependencies with :
npm add react-native
npm add react
npm add hermesvm
npm add jsc-android

Run the application by going into the file directory and use the command npm run android. 
If this has some issues you can build the app in android studio and run npm run start 
to start the metro bundler separately.
